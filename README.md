# djent
djent is a reimplementation of the Fourmilab/John Walker random number test program ent.

The improvements are:

* Multiple input file names can be provided at once. This works nicely with the CSV format output.
* -h works are well as -u to get the help information.
* Filename is present in CSV output
* The symbol size can be any number of bits up to 32. ent was constrained to 1 or 8.

Planned improvements are:

* Bit reversal options
* Adding Lag-N Correlation Coefficient
